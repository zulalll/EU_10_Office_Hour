-Why functional interface?
There are some build in functional interfaces,methods,that we can use so it will help us to make our work easier.

-Boiled code:means crowded codes.

-We create normal interface and will put @FunctionalInterface annotation.

-Lambda exp. are easy to use but not easy to read.

-about FI we need to know build-in functions.

-T means any kind of data type.

-Lambda expression is like method body, it has no return type,return type is determined by which FI are you using.

-'Bi-' suffix means double.

- Predicate is returning boolean, consumer is like void, function is like return.
