-If we do not have constructor, we can not create object.(do not forget default constructor)
-As constructor same with class name, it starts with uppercase.
-Initializing is giving first value.

Office hours:Encapsulation
-Putting all data in a capsule.(ex:capsulated pills from pharmacy)
-Data hiding =data protection eg:for bank apps.if someone changes your bank account number, your money will disappear.
-logic of encapsulation:you have a class and in that class you have private variables.Then to use these variables we use
public getter and setter methods.We are accessing them undirectly.
-getter is for reading, setter is for writing.

-Is it possible to change getter and setter method names?
yes, we can but it is not recommended.

-The main aim of these methods is that providing pre-condition for our private data.
-Encapsulation is a design pattern.Polymorphism is not but other three are design patterns.


-Method overloading:
same method name,return type do not matter,parameter is different.(different parameter=>data type or number of
parameter or order of parameters.)

-Method overriding:
  -It must happen in sub-class.


-Difference of method overloading-overriding so popular interview question.(IQ)

-What kind of variables should we put as a final?(IQ) => Company name,ID,planet,social security number,birthday.

-In bank system ==>account number, text number anything about your account can not be changeable.

-Why final class can not be parent? We can not change anything in it.

-What is difference between throws, throwable and throw?IQ
Throwable - class name
throws - handle exception
throw  - create exception
